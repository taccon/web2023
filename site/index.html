            <h1><strong>Great freeware.</strong> Since 2002.</h1>
            <p>We were born as a hobby project to create freeware for Desktop computers that would be a good alternative to commercial software. We started in 2002, with our roots reaching back to 1999.</p>
            <p>Over the years we created many software projects. Some of them still exist and you can find them here on our homepage. Others were discontinued. But we love all of them!</p>
            <p><strong>Thank you. We hope you are okay.</strong></p>

            <p>Creating installers just got easier! With Cetup you create and manage your setups for Windows in a simple and clear environment that allows you to quickly set up all the details you need. It is based on NSIS, so for more complex situations everything can be adapted with a simple scripting language.</p>
