            <h1><strong>Great freeware.</strong> Since 2002.</h1>
            <p>We were born as a hobby project to create freeware for Desktop computers that would be a good alternative
                to commercial software. We started in 2002, with our roots reaching back to 1999.</p>
            <p>Over the years we created many software projects. Some of them still exist and you can find them here on
                our homepage. Others were discontinued. But we love all of them!</p>
            <p><strong>Thank you. We hope you are okay.</strong></p>

            <p>Cetup is one of our oldest projects. It started its life in 2002 as "InstallChild" which was developed as
                a free alternative for commercial installers for Windows. It made it very easy to create your own
                installations by following a simple assistant interface. The project was renamed to Cetup later and
                large parts were rewritten. The first version of Cetup still worked with an assistant interface but also
                featured a custom script engine called "Ckript" allowed you to change almost everything about the
                installation process.</p>
            <p>After not being maintained for a couple of years, Cetup has been rewritten from the scratch and came back
                as a software that allows you to easily create installations based on NSIS, still combining the
                simplicity of an assistant interface with the scripting power of NSIS, if it's needed.</p>

                    <p>Is 2022 still time for a classic media player like back in the old days? Sure it is! While most
                        of the time you enjoy streaming services, there is still a huge collection of high-quality files
                        somewhere on your hard-drive waiting for you.</p>
                    <p>New audioplayer3 lets you discover them again and organise them in playlists. No bloated media
                        library but simple management that does not destroy your folder structure.</p>
